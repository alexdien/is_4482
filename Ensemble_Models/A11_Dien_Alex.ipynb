It is used to improve the overall performance of a model by reducing overfitting and increasing the generalizability of the model. In the voting ensemble method, multiple models are trained on the same dataset and their predictions are combined using one of several voting strategies. The most common strategy is called \"hard voting,\" in which the final prediction is the one that is most frequently predicted by the individual models. Other voting strategies include \"soft voting,\" in which the final prediction is based on the average of the predicted probabilities of the individual models, and \"weighted voting,\" in which each model is assigned a weight based on its performance and the final prediction is based on the weighted average of the individual model predictions. Overall, the voting ensemble method can be a powerful tool for improving the performance of machine learning models."],"metadata":{"id":"7Hl-QFrekizB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BG06VTQO3sSJ"},"source":["# Task 5 - Boosting Model \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qyndpkYK40vj"},"source":["### 1.

It works by training weak learners sequentially, each one trying to correct the mistakes of the previous weak learner. By combining the predictions of these weak learners, the boosting algorithm is able to make more accurate predictions than any of the individual weak learners would be able to on their own. Typically, the weak learners used in boosting are decision trees, although other types of models can also be used.
